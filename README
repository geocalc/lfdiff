lfdiff - Large File Diff

This program is able to create diffs of files larger than 30GB or 7 billion
lines.
The traditional diff algorithm has an order of O(nÂ²) where n corresponds to
the size of the files. Newer algorithms have orders of O(n*log(n)) or even
O(n). But still a run with the GNU diff utility comparing two files of 40GB
need approximately 100GB RAM.
This program feeds small slices of the two files to the "diff" program which
in turn needs much less memory. The size of the slieces is configurable, so
the amount of RAM needed can be adjusted for low memory machines.

Recent measurements of the amount of memory comparing two files of 40GB each
resulted in less than 8GB RAM for the whole diff run. A further improovement
in the splitting algorithm can result in some megabytes RAM usage for multi
GB file sizes. Consult the source code for further information.

The diff output is traditional diff:
HEADER
> lines added
---
< lines removed
Other formats are not considered.

This program shall ease the comparison of very large files.
Have fun.
