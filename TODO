1) push intermediate results early

If we have a definite block differing which does not change during the
further inspection of the two files we can write out the diff block and free
the memory used. This way we can keep the memory usage very low, expecting
around some hundred kilo bytes memory usage overall.

2) handle missing newline at the end of file

if a new line is missing on one of the files diff prints an additional message
at the end of the stream "\ No newline at end of file".
This line has to be recognized by the parser and handled differently from the
ordinary lines.
Maybe cutting the newline of the line in the diff container? then recognize this
during the print output?

the test code is already available in the tests directory
