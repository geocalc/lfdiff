1) handle input from stdin

on the command line set input file = '-' as standard input channel.
Then get the average line count of the second file 
( = spliz size * (line cnt / file size) ). Now cut of average count line numbers
from stdin and feed to the external diff program on its stdin channel along 
with the split chunk from the second file.

We need a shell call with stdin and stdout connected to the lfdiff program.


2) handle missing newline at the end of file

if a new line is missing on one of the files diff prints an additional message
at the end of the stream "\ No newline at end of file".
This line has to be recognized by the parser and handled differently from the
ordinary lines.
Maybe cutting the newline of the line in the diff container? then recognize this
during the print output?

the test code is already available in the tests directory
